# movie_api: DeppFlix

Building the server-side component of a “movies” web application with the MERN stack. <br><br>
The web application will provide users with access to information about Johnny Depp's different movies, their directors and genres.
Those users will be able to sign up, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.
<br><br>
An extensive documentation for the project is constantly being updated and despite the slow yet steady loss of my sanity, this project shall be done before mid November as part of my Full-Stack WebDev course @CareerFoundry.com!
<br><br>
I cannot wait to present the final result.. 😎
