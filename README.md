# movie_api: DeppFlix

Building the server-side component of a “movies” web application with the MERN stack. <br><br>
The web application will provide users with access to information about Johnny Depp's different movies, their directors and genres.<br>
Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.
<br><br>
There is an extensive documentation that is constamtly updated and despite the slow yet steady loss of my sanity, this project will be done before mid October as part of my Full-Stack WebDev course @CareerFoundry.com!
<br><br>
I cannot wait to present the final result.. 😎
